# django-mini-project2

THIS IS A SOLO PROJECT.

A new company called WaterWave need a website for their subscribers to see their playlists. To do this, create an entirely new project from stratch. Make a site that will display your SQLite database entries. The attributes should be songName, album, artist, duration, and rating. Use the admin portal to add entries. Make your localhost root show all entries in the database.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their project. Use instructions provided by the tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/.
